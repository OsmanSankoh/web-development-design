      <p>It is my privilege to welcome you to The Covenant School, where for more than 35 years, we have been engaged in the high calling of teaching the next generation to live well.
  
          Selecting the best education for your child is one of the most important decisions you will make as a parent. Covenant’s college-preparatory education enables students to explore their God-given interests and make connections across disciplines. This teaching is undergirded by a Biblical worldview that acknowledges Christ as the center of all things. The foundation of the school is the infallible Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, as interpreted in the historic Christian Confessions. The school is not an ecclesiastical body, nor is it subject to any ecclesiastical organization.
          
          I hope you’ll enjoy exploring our website, to see the many ways in which this educational approach creates curious, engaged, tenacious young men and women, prepared to face the world’s challenges with courage and compassion. Moreover, I invite you to visit us on campus soon to observe classes, meet faculty, and discover for yourself what is unique about The Covenant School.
          
          Finally, I want to honor the work of our retired Headmaster, George Sanker. During his time here, George proved himself to be a man of intelligence, wisdom, winsomeness, and humility. He attended to his labors with an enthusiastic love for the Lord and love for life. His legacy of strong servant-leadership has indelibly shaped this institution, and we praise God for having brought him here. We look forward to continuing to see his contagious smile around our campuses.
          
          Blessings,
           
          Frank Berry
          Interim Head of School, CFO/COO</p>
